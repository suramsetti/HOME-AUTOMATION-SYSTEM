2:Blynk Integration

Uses Blynk Cloud API to send commands remotely.

Virtual Pins (V0 & V1) control the devices.

Sends an HTTP request to the Blynk server when a button is clicked.

How It Works:

When the user clicks a button, the toggleDevice() function makes a request to Blynkâ€™s cloud API.

This request updates the virtual pin state (1 for ON, 0 for OFF).

The ESP8266 microcontroller (running Blynk firmware) receives the update and toggles the corresponding relay.

Customization:
Replace # Your Auth token with your Blynk authentication token.

Add more devices by assigning new virtual pins (V2, V3, etc.).

Modify the CSS styles for a more personalized look.
